    The API key is used for authentication and helps users send requests at scale. Here's how to obtain one:
    <ol>
        <li>Log in to the NeuVector cluster.</li>
        <li>Navigate to <strong>Settings</strong> -> <strong>Users/ApiKeys</strong> -> <strong>API Keys</strong>.</li>
        <li>Create an API key with permissions for scanning and consider assigning it a longer timeout value.</li>
    </ol>
</div>
